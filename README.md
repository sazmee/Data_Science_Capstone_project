Car Price Prediction - Streamlit App
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Car Price Prediction Streamlit App! This project aims to provide a user-friendly web application that predicts the price of a car based on various features. The app is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating interactive web applications.

Features
Predict the price of a car based on its features.
Explore the dataset and visualize the data.
Input various car features, such as mileage, brand, year, and more, to get an estimated price.
The app uses a trained machine learning model to make predictions.
Model Deployment
We are pleased to announce that the project has been successfully deployed using Streamlit. You can access the live deployment of the Car Price Prediction model by following this link: Car Price Prediction Deployment

Usage
Once you access the Streamlit app, you will be able to interact with the model's user-friendly interface. Simply input the relevant features of the car you want to predict the price for, and the model will provide you with an estimated price based on the trained data. Feel free to experiment with different combinations of features and explore the model's performance.

Feedback and Contributions
Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated. If you encounter any issues, have suggestions for improvement, or would like to contribute to the project, please don't hesitate to create an issue or submit a pull request in this repository.

Let's start predicting car prices! Enjoy using the Car Price Prediction model deployed on Streamlit.

Note : This project is for educational purposes only, and the predicted prices should not be considered as definitive values for real-world transactions.

Installation
To run the Car Price Prediction Streamlit App on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:git clone https://github.com/06Neel/Data-Science-Capstone-Project.git

Navigate to the project directory:cd car-price-prediction-streamlit

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and activate it:python -m venv venv

For Windows:venv\Scripts\activate
For Unix or Linux:source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit app:streamlit run app.py

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to access the Car Price Prediction app.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is included in this repository.

Please download the dataset and place it in the data directory of this repository before running the app.

Project Structure
The repository has the following structure:

car-price-prediction-streamlit/ ├── app.py ├── data/ │ └── comapany.csv ├── models/ │ └── Model.pkl ├── README.md └── requirements.txt

app.py: The main Python script that contains the Streamlit app code.
data/: Directory to store the dataset file (comapany.csv).
models/: Directory to store the trained machine learning model file (Model.pkl).
README.md: This readme file.
requirements.txt: List of Python packages required to run the app.
Model Training
The machine learning model used in the app is trained separately and saved as a serialized file (Model.pkl) in the models directory. If you wish to train your own model, you can refer to the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.
